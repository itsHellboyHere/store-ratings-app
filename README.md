## API Base URL Configuration

The frontend automatically sets the API base URL depending on where it is running:

- **Local Development:**  
  Uses `http://localhost:5000/api` as the backend API base URL.

- **Production:**  
  Uses `https://store-ratings-app.onrender.com/api` as the backend API base URL.

This is determined dynamically in the frontend code by checking the current hostname
